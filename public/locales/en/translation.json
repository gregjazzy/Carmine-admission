    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What commitment does this require from the family?",
      "answer": "Serious mentoring is teamwork. I expect consistency in sessions, transparency on transcripts and goals, and real parent involvement in orientation decisions. In return, I commit to personalized follow-up and genuine availability between sessions."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "When should we start?",
      "answer": "The earlier, the better. Ideally 6th-7th grade: we build the math foundations, choose the right curriculum, anticipate the key transitions. But I also work with students who come in during 11th or 12th grade — the work is different, more intensive, but the results are there."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How many students do you take on?",
      "answer": "Few. I follow each student personally, sometimes over several years. It's not a scalable model and that's by design. If I'm full, I'll tell you — I'd rather say no than do it halfway."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What does the process look like?",
      "answer": "We start with a diagnostic: current level, ambitions, target schools. From there I propose a work plan. Sessions are weekly, in person or via video. I check in regularly with parents and adjust based on results and deadlines."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Do you work with families abroad?",
      "answer": "Most of my clients are expats or between two countries. I work via video with families in Dubai, Singapore, London, New York. French system, AEFE schools, IB, BFI — I know these curricula and more importantly, how they translate in admissions files."
